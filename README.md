Simply Time Watchface
===============================

My private watchface, started from https://github.com/android/wear-os-samples/tree/main/WatchFaceKotlin.

For you to run it, you need to get fonts and put them into app/src/.../res/font folder. To be exact two fonts - digital.ttf and digital_empty.ttf (names are customs), one as main font and another for when your screen is ambient.
